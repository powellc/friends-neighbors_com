CIS-Dept. Plain Skin for PmWiki 2
=================================
INSTALL.txt

This skin installs in two easy steps:
1) Put the files in the correct location.
2) Configure PmWiki to use the skin with some lines in the
   local configuration file.


Step 1 - Copy files.
--------------------
Copy the plain/ directory to your wiki's pub/skins/ directory.


Step 2 - Edit local configuration file.
---------------------------------------
The following lines go in your local/config.php local configuration
file.

## Use the CIS-Dept. Plain Skin.
$Skin = 'plain';

If you don't have a local/config.php yet you'll need to create one.
Make sure that "<?php" is the very first line, with no leading spaces.
You don't need a closing "?>". Here's an example local/config.php:

<?php if (!defined('PmWiki')) exit();
## Title of this wiki
$WikiTitle = 'My Site';

## Use the CIS-Dept. Plain Skin.
$Skin = 'plain';

## Set administrative and edit passwords.
$DefaultPasswords['admin'] = '$1$xNI5oUI9$vQtoUEMmyYUfYGWX3msvJ/';
$DefaultPasswords['edit']  = '$1$/SnWxwWp$AnX/biQACqM9VtCnVrdcK.';

## Require Author Name to save an edited page.
$EnablePostAuthorRequired = 1;

## Keep read-protected pages from appearing in search results.
$EnablePageListProtect = 1;

## Require approval of links to external sites.
include_once('scripts/urlapprove.php');
$UnapprovedLinkCountMax = 10;

## Enable RSS and Atom web feeds.
if ($action == 'rss' || $action == 'atom') {
include_once("scripts/feeds.php"); }

## Enable ?action=refcount for finding missing and orphaned pages.
if ($action == 'refcount') {
  $HandleAuth['refcount'] = 'edit';
  include_once('scripts/refcount.php'); }


Enjoy!
