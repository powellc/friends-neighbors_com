About the skin
--------------
This is another clean, minimalist skin for PmWiki 2 that was created with
usability in mind.  This skin emphasizes the content with a nice big
easy-to-read default font size and no graphical frills.

The skin produces valid XHTML 1.0 and CSS output according to w3c.org's
validation services at http://validator.w3.org/ and
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ respectively.
